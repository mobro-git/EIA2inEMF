# The .Renviron file sets environment variables which can be used in an R session
# It is good for setting options, user/computer-specific paths, and secrets like API keys

# You can create or edit either a user-specific or project-specific .Renviron file and add the following line, substituting your own EIA api key. I generally prefer a user-level .Renviron file. If both exist, R will only pay attention to the project-level one. You can create or edit your user-level .Renviron file by running: usethis::edit_r_environ("user") or with command save-as this file into ".Renviron".

# fill in your own EIA api key below, get one here: https://www.eia.gov/opendata/
